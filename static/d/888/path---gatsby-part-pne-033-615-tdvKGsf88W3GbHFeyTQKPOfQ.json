It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into\nelectronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in\nthe 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,\nand more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including\nversions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>\n<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>\n<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable\ncontent of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum\nis that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using\n'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.\nMany desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem\nIpsum as their default model text and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will\nuncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved\nover the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose\n(injected humor and the like).</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Gatsby part 1","description":"This post is related to the gatsbyjs","image":null}},"site":{"siteMetadata":{"title":"Blog"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/gatsby-part-pne/"}}
